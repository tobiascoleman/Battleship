<h3>Rules for BattleShip (a Milton Bradley Game)</h3>
<h3><a name="objective"><b>Game Objective</b></a></h3>
<p>The object of Battleship is to try and sink all of the other player's before
    they sink all of your ships. All of the other player's ships are somewhere on
    his/her board.&nbsp; You try and hit them by calling out the coordinates of one
    of the squares on the board.&nbsp; The other player also tries to hit your ships
    by calling out coordinates.&nbsp; Neither you nor the other player can see the
    other's board so you must try to guess where they are.&nbsp; Each board in the
    physical game has two grids:&nbsp; the lower (horizontal) section for the
    player's ships and the upper part (vertical during play) for recording the
    player's guesses.</p>
<h3><a name="start">Starting a New Game</a></h3>
<p>Each player places the 5 ships somewhere on their board.&nbsp; The ships can
    only be placed vertically or horizontally. Diagonal placement is not allowed. No
    part of a ship may hang off the edge of the board.&nbsp; Ships may not overlap
    each other.&nbsp; No ships may be placed on another ship.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Once the guessing begins, the players may not move the ships.</p>
<p>The 5 ships are:&nbsp; Carrier (occupies 5 spaces), Battleship (4), Cruiser
    (3), Submarine (3), and Destroyer (2).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="playing">Playing the Game</a></h3>
<p>Player's take turns guessing by calling out the coordinates. The opponent
    responds with "hit" or "miss" as appropriate.&nbsp; Both
    players should mark their board with pegs:&nbsp; red for hit, white for miss.
    For example, if you call out F6 and your opponent does not have any ship located
    at F6, your opponent would respond with "miss".&nbsp; You record the
    miss F6 by placing a white peg on the lower part of your board at F6.&nbsp; Your
    opponent records the miss by placing.</p>
<p>When all of the squares that one your ships occupies have been hit, the ship
    will be sunk.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should announce "hit and sunk".&nbsp; In
    the physical game, a red peg is placed on the top edge of the vertical board to
    indicate a sunk ship.&nbsp; </p>
As soon as all of one player's ships have been sunk, the game ends.

<h3><a name="salvo">Salvo Rules</a></h3>
<p>
    All rules for salvo are the same except that each player gets to choose five coordinates to launch
    their attack&nbsp;, and at the end of their five attacks, the state of each guess is revealed.
</p>
